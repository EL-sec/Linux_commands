### **Difference Between Log Rotation and Recorder**

| Feature        | **Log Rotation** | **Recorder** |
|---------------|----------------|-------------|
| **Purpose**    | Manages and organizes log files | Continuously records data (logs, audio, video, etc.) |
| **Functionality** | Moves old logs, renames them, and deletes old files | Captures and stores data for future use |
| **Trigger Mechanism** | Happens based on file size, time, or manual execution | Runs continuously or on demand |
| **Output** | Archived log files with timestamps | A live or stored record of events |
| **Use Case** | Prevents logs from growing too large and consuming disk space | Keeps a record of events for monitoring or analysis |
| **Example** | `logrotate` in Linux, moving logs to an archive folder | A security camera recording video or a script logging network activity |

### **How They Work in Your Case**
- **Log Rotation:** In your Bash script, logs are moved to an archive and cleaned up after 30 days. This prevents unlimited log growth.
- **Recorder:** Your script is also **recording** log entries from a named pipe (`PIPENAME`) and writing them to a log file.

In short:  
- **A script acts as a recorder** because it continuously writes logs.  
- **The log rotation function manages recorded logs** to keep storage clean.
