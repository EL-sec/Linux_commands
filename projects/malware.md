## 📌 **1.1 What is Malware?**  
🔹 **Definition**: Malware (Malicious Software) is a program designed to disrupt, damage, or gain unauthorized access to a computer system.  
🔹 **Goals of Malware**:  
   - **Steal Data** (Banking Trojans, Keyloggers)  
   - **Cause Disruptions** (Worms, Ransomware)  
   - **Gain Unauthorized Access** (Rootkits, RATs)  
   - **Spy on Users** (Spyware, Pegasus)

## 📌 **1.2 Types of Malware**  

| Malware Type  | Description | Real-World Example |
|--------------|------------|--------------------|
| **Trojan** | Disguised as legitimate software but executes malicious code. | Zeus Trojan (Banking malware) |
| **Worm** | Self-replicates and spreads across networks. | WannaCry (Exploited SMBv1 vulnerability) |
| **Ransomware** | Encrypts user files and demands payment. | Locky, REvil, WannaCry |
| **Keylogger** | Records keystrokes to steal credentials. | Hawkeye Keylogger |
| **Rootkit** | Hides malware presence from OS and security tools. | Stuxnet (Kernel-mode rootkit) |
| **Spyware** | Secretly gathers user information. | Pegasus (Spyware used by governments) |
| **Adware** | Unwanted ads, redirects users to malicious sites. | Fireball Adware |

## 📌 **1.3 Common Attack Vectors**  

Malware is delivered through different methods, including:  

### 📨 **Phishing Attacks**  
🔹 Fake emails with malicious attachments or links.  
🔹 Example: **Emotet malware** spreads through phishing emails.  

### 💻 **Exploits & Vulnerabilities**  
🔹 Attackers exploit software flaws (**Zero-days, RCEs, Buffer Overflows**).  
🔹 Example: **EternalBlue exploit** used by WannaCry.  

### 🌐 **Drive-by Downloads**  
🔹 Malicious scripts automatically download malware when a user visits an infected website.  
🔹 Example: **Angler Exploit Kit** used to spread ransomware.  

### 👥 **Social Engineering**  
🔹 Tricking users into **installing malware** (e.g., Fake software updates).  
🔹 Example: **Tech support scams** convincing users to download RATs.

## 📌 **1.4 Malware in the Real World: Case Studies**  

### 🦠 **Case Study 1: WannaCry Ransomware (2017)**  
🔹 Exploited **EternalBlue SMBv1 vulnerability**.  
🔹 **Infected 230,000+ computers** in over 150 countries.  
🔹 **Ransom demand**: $300–$600 in Bitcoin.  
🔹 **Mitigation**: **Patch SMBv1 (MS17-010)** and disable unnecessary services.  

### 🏭 **Case Study 2: Stuxnet Worm (2010)**  
🔹 First-ever **cyber weapon** targeting **Iran’s nuclear program**.  
🔹 Spread via **USB drives** and infected **SCADA systems**.  
🔹 Used **Zero-day exploits** and **rootkit techniques**.  
🔹 **Impact**: Damaged **centrifuges** in Natanz, Iran.  

### 📱 **Case Study 3: Pegasus Spyware**  
🔹 Developed by **NSO Group** for **government surveillance**.  
🔹 Exploits **zero-click vulnerabilities** in WhatsApp and iMessage.  
🔹 Can **record calls, steal messages, track GPS, and control the camera**.  
🔹 Found in **journalists' and activists' phones** worldwide.

## 🛠 **Hands-on Lab: Basic Malware Report Analysis**  

### 🎯 **Objective:**  
Students will analyze **real-world malware samples** from online repositories.  

### **Step 1: Open Public Malware Repositories**  
✅ [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/) - Check malware hashes and scans.  
✅ [Hybrid Analysis](https://www.hybrid-analysis.com/) - Detailed behavior analysis.  
✅ [ANY.RUN](https://any.run/) - Interactive malware sandbox.  

### **Step 2: Analyze a Known Malware Sample**  
1️⃣ Search for "**WannaCry sample hash**" in VirusTotal.  
2️⃣ View **static analysis** (PE file info, signatures, YARA matches).  
3️⃣ Check **dynamic behavior** (API calls, network requests).  

### **Step 3: Identify Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)**  
🔍 Hashes (SHA256, MD5)  
🔍 IP Addresses & Domains used by malware  
🔍 File system modifications
