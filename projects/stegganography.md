### **Lesson 1: Introduction to Steganography**  
**Objective:** Students will understand the concept of steganography, its purpose, and how it differs from cryptography.

**Activities:**  
1. **Presentation & Discussion**  
   - Define steganography and its importance in cybersecurity.  
   - Compare steganography vs. cryptography with real-world examples.  
   - Show historical examples (e.g., invisible ink, microdots, null ciphers).  

2. **Hands-on Practical: Identifying Hidden Data**  
   - Provide students with a set of images, some with hidden data and some without.  
   - Use tools like `Stegsolve` to analyze and determine if an image contains hidden messages.  
   - Encourage students to think about steganography detection techniques.

### **Lesson 2: Image Steganography**  
**Objective:** Students will learn how to hide and extract messages from images.  

**Activities:**  
1. **Least Significant Bit (LSB) Insertion**  
   - Explain how the least significant bit in pixel values is modified to hide data.  
   - Demonstrate this manually by converting pixel values to binary and altering them.  

2. **Practical Exercise: Using Steghide**  
   - Install `Steghide` on Kali Linux (`sudo apt install steghide`).  
   - Use the following commands to hide and extract data from an image:

     **Hiding data:**  
     ```bash
     steghide embed -cf image.jpg -ef secret.txt -p password
     ```
     **Extracting data:**  
     ```bash
     steghide extract -sf image.jpg -p password
     ```

3. **Stegsolve for Image Analysis**  
   - Use `Stegsolve` to analyze different image layers.  
   - Students inspect images for anomalies.

### **Lesson 3: Audio Steganography**  
**Objective:** Students will hide and extract messages from audio files.  

**Activities:**  
1. **Understanding Audio Steganography**  
   - Explain how modifying frequency or amplitude can embed hidden data.  
   - Discuss tools like `Sonic Visualiser` and `DeepSound`.  

2. **Practical Exercise: Using DeepSound**  
   - Install `DeepSound` on Windows (or use Wine on Kali).  
   - Hide text inside an audio file and extract it.  

3. **Analyzing Audio Files with Sonic Visualiser**  
   - Open an audio file and visualize waveforms and spectrograms.  
   - Try to detect hidden messages.

### **Lesson 4: Advanced Steganography & Detection Techniques**  
**Objective:** Students will learn advanced steganography techniques and how forensic analysts detect hidden messages.  

**Activities:**  
1. **Exploring Different Steganography Techniques**  
   - Discuss Redundant Pattern Encoding, Encrypt & Scatter methods.  

2. **Practical Exercise: Steganalysis**  
   - Use `stegdetect` to analyze images:  
     ```bash
     stegdetect image.jpg
     ```
   - Perform statistical analysis on modified images.  

3. **Red Team vs. Blue Team Exercise**  
   - Divide students into attackers (hiding messages) and defenders (detecting them).  
   - Use a set of images/audio files to challenge each other.
