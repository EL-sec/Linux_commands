# Webdeves Ethical Hacking Final Project (Team Devil)
## **Project Title: Network Vulnerability Scanner**

### **Objective**:
Create a Python-based tool that scans a local network for devices, detects open ports and common vulnerabilities, and reports insecure configurations — all in a safe, controlled lab environment.

### **Core Features**:
1. **Network Discovery**:
   - Use `socket` to perform ARP scans or ping sweeps.
   - Identify all devices on a subnet.

2. **Port Scanning**:
   - Use `socket` or `nmap` via `python-nmap` to scan for open ports.
   - Banner grabbing to detect services and versions.

3. **Vulnerability Detection**:
   - Match services to known vulnerable versions using CVE data or static rules.
   - Check for:
     - Telnet running on open ports
     - FTP anonymous login enabled
     - Outdated SSH versions

4. **Report Generation**:
   - Output findings to a structured report (PDF/HTML/CSV).
   - Include recommended remediations.

5. **Bonus Features (Advanced)**:
   - Web-based dashboard (Flask/Django) to manage scans.
   - Email alerts for high-severity findings.
   - Add CVSS scoring logic for detected issues.

### **Tools & Libraries**:
- `scapy` – for packet crafting and sniffing
- `python-nmap` – wrapper around Nmap
- `socket` – for basic networking
- `requests` – for checking HTTP headers and vulnerabilities
- `argparse` – for command-line options
- `fpdf` or `Jinja2 + WeasyPrint` – for PDF reports
- `shodan` API (optional) – for checking if a public IP is exposed

```

### **Setup Instructions**:
- Configure a lab network (e.g., using VirtualBox/VMware with Metasploitable, DVWA, or vulnerable Linux hosts).
- Run the scanner against lab IP ranges only.
- Ensure all students sign an **Ethical Hacking Agreement** before using the tool.

### **Real-World Learning Impact**:
- Understand how vulnerabilities are identified in a network.
- Gain experience with tools used in vulnerability assessments.
- Learn the importance of responsible disclosure and ethical boundaries.
- Build a portfolio-worthy project that mimics what real penetration testers do.

### **Deliverables**:
1. Python source code
2. User manual / README
3. Sample scan report
4. Documentation of ethical usage
